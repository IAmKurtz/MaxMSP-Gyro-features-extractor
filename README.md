# MaxMSP-Gyro-features-extractor

My MaxMSP features extractor can be used to analyze data from a gyroscope: in particular pitch, roll and yaw. A gyro could be really useful to control in a gestural way some audio features, and this extractor is an easy way to receive, route and send data from your smartphone to MaxMSP and from MaxMSP to Wekinator. The only thing you have to do is type the IP address and the number of the port in your app.
